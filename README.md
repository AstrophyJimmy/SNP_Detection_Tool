# Customizable SNP Detection Tool
This tool reads two fasta files containing the same genomic sequence length and returns the SNPs detected in them. 
Please be sure of the following for the tool to work correctly, 
1. upload only 2 files, and the original sequence file should have the string 'seq' in it and the query doesn't.
2. be sure that both sequences are of equal length.
3. be sure to run all the cells so you can download the figure and the output text file at the end.
4. Careful to follow the following instructions accurately. 

## Running instructions
1. click "Open in Playground".
2. from the upper taskbar choose "Runtime" > "Run All".
3. Choose files in the output of the third cell.
